However, this does not correspond to the standard usage of 'pupal stage' for cyclorrhaphous flies (for discussion see: FBrf0087128). Briefly: formation of the puparium (hardening of the larval cuticle) marks the beginning of the pre-pupal stage. The pupal stage begins following pupal/larval apolysis - detachment of the larval epidermis from the puparium. In Drosophila, the outward sign of the completion of apolysis is the eversion of the head an expulsion of the larval mouthparts (FBrf0036849). We use P-stage to refer to the stage from pupariation to eclosion, and restrict pupal stage to its standard usage."^^xsd:string)
